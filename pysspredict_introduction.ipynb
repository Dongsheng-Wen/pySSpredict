    "# Introduction to pySSpredict\n",
    "\n",
    "**pySSpredict** is a **Py**thon-based tool for **S**olid-solution **S**trengthening **predict**ion for complex-concentrated alloys. It can be easily installed on the high-throughput computation resources and integrated with TC-Python for desiging high-temperature high-strength structural materials. \n",
